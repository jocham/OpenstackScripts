# OpenstackScripts
Scripts used to set up Openstack RHEL/CentOS

Each script has a discription. 

You can run the scripts individually, or the Master.sh will run all other scripts.

*SUDO is required!

How to use:
1. Clone or copy the .sh files to any directory on your new Openstack RHEL/CentOS machine.
2. (Optional) Run all scripts:
      sudo ./Master.sh
3. Run individual scripts:
      sudo ./<scriptname>
  ex:
      sudo ./ChangeHostname.sh
